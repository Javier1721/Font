    <h1>Thinkin Bout You</h1>
    <h3>By Frank Ocean</h3>
    <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
    <p> tornado flew around my room before you came
    Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in
    Southern California, much like Arizona
    My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they pour when</p>
    
    <h2>[Pre-Chorus]</h2>
    <p>I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
    I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
    I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
    Do ya, do ya?</p>
    
    <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
    <p1> do you not think so far ahead?
    'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
    Or do you not think so far ahead?
    'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh</p1>
    
    <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
    <p>No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
    Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
    Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
    That's why I kissed you
    Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down
</p>
    <h2>[Pre-Chorus]</h2>
    <p>Thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
    I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
    I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
    Do ya, do ya?
</p>
    
    <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
    <p1>Or do you not think so far ahead?
    'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
    Or do you not think so far ahead?
    'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
</p1>
    <h2>[Bridge]</h2>
    <p>Yes, of course, I remember, how could I forget (How could I forget?) how you feel? (How you feel)
    You know you were my first time, a new feel
    It won't ever get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
    We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white
</p>
    <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
    <p1>Or do you not think so far ahead?
    'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
    Or do you not think so far ahead?
    'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
</p1>
